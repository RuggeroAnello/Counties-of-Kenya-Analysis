# Counties of Kenya Analysis

This project provides an in-depth analysis of the social and economic indicators for Kenya's 47 counties. Data from the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics is utilized to explore variations in economic performance, population demographics, and education across counties. This analysis leverages three key datasets:

- **Gross_County_Product**: Contains data on the Gross County Product (GCP) for each county, reflecting economic output.
- **Population**: Provides population figures for each county, enabling demographic insights.
- **Education**: Covers primary and secondary student enrollment statistics, aiding in understanding education trends by county.

The analysis includes examining the relationships between these variables to reveal how economic and social factors interact across different regions in Kenya. 

## Key Insights and Methodology

- **Economic Insights**: The Gross County Product data provides a ranking of counties based on economic output, allowing us to identify the wealthiest counties as well as those experiencing the highest growth rates.
- **Population Analysis**: By examining population data, we gain insights into the distribution of Kenya’s population and can calculate GCP per capita for each county.
- **Educational Trends**: The Education dataset reveals county-specific trends in student enrollment, focusing particularly on secondary education and its relationship to economic growth.

This analysis serves as a foundation for understanding the diversity among Kenya's counties and the factors influencing their development.

## Getting Started

1. **Data**: All datasets can be found in the `Data` folder.
2. **Database**: To replicate or extend this analysis, ensure the data is stored in a database accessible for querying.
